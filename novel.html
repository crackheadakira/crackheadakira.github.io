                        <h2>Chapter 1 - The Losing of Virginity</h2>
                    </center>
                    <p>My name is Rak Dilf and I was abused by my parents a lot so I decided to run away and
                        make a living as
                        a scammer, as I was pretty much a genius in that area. After earning myself some money
                        to live a
                        stable life without working I discovered alcohol and drugs. I ate and drank those as if they were
                        candy for a solid
                        3 years until on my 12th birthday when I decided to lose my virginity in a brothel.</p>

                    <p>I had chosen the most top-class brothel there was in Hungoden, the capital of Domaliyas a
                        country situated
                        between Australia and Japan. The brothel had so many top-class girls it was quite
                        difficult choosing
                        what girl I should fuck, I felt like I was in a candy store. After a
                        few minutes of difficult eliminations I ended up going with a girl at the age of 22 by
                        the name of
                        Samantha Iglias, I had heard about the Iglias family a few years ago on TV when I still
                        hadn't run
                        away from home. Apparently they were some rich family that had all of a sudden gone
                        bankrupt so I
                        can see why they'd need a job, the daughters of the family were pretty fucking beautiful
                        so this
                        type of job was perfect for them. The men though were probably home waiting for the
                        girls paychecks
                        so they could spend it all on booze.</p>

                    <p>I walked up to the reception desk to order Samantha Iglias, the employees over at the
                        reception desk
                        gave me a strange look. I could obviously tell what they meant with that look though.
                        'What is that
                        kid doing over here in a brothel? Who allowed him to be here?' I was obviously
                        unconcerned as I had
                        the perfect excuse for myself, I had the turner disease and was actually 23. I even had
                        a fake ID
                        to prove it.</p>

                    <p>"Hi, I'd like to book Samantha Iglias for tonight." I said calmly but with a bit of
                        attitude to make
                        me seem more mature. "I require your ID as you look a bit too young to be here, Sir."
                    </p>

                    <p>I said, "Ah, Here's my ID. The reason why I look so young is because I have Turner's
                        Disease, it's a
                        disease that slows your growth so in reality I'm 23 years old." as I handed it to the
                        young man at
                        the counter.
                    </p>

                    <p>"Everything seems to checkout" he said a few seconds later
                    </p>

                    <p>I was then handed a keycard for room 11 and told to wait there for Samantha. As I headed
                        over to room
                        11 I could hear moaning through the thin walls of the brothel, a lot of the girls
                        sounded like they
                        were not having a good time. When I arrived in front of room 11, the first thing that
                        stood out to
                        me was the old looking door. It would seem as if this room had not been put to use in a
                        few years.
                        Thankfully the interior for the room was much more modern looking, the room was big
                        enough to fit
                        3 king-sized beds and a bathtub. Right against the wall in the center of the room was a
                        king-sized
                        bed with some sex toys on the drawers next to it.
                    </p>

                    <p>I decided to sit down right on the bed and wait for Samantha. I waited about 15 minutes
                        for her to arrive,
                        but when she did arrive I almost instantly came in my pants. She looked so much more
                        beautiful than
                        the picture, she had about C cup breasts and my lord her ass was so big I could use one
                        cheek as
                        a pillow oh and don't get me even started on the thighs. She was wearing a tight black
                        dress with
                        an opening for breasts that were just small enough that you couldn't see the nipples,
                        but that dress
                        did bring out her best features. Long curvy blond hair, a bit droopy breasts, a bit of
                        eyeshadow
                        and some red lipstick.
                    </p>

                    <p>"I take it you're Rak, my client?" she said in a a quiet, calming voice. It made me doubt
                        how could a
                        person like that exist?
                    </p>

                    <p>"Y..yes" I fumbled as if i was a baby, well I was a child but not a baby. "I do.. don't
                        really like small
                        talk. Suck me off, and make sure to use your tongue" I'd be surprised if she did not
                        comply as I
                        used such a commandering tone even a grown man would even listen to my orders.
                    </p>

                    <p>She slowly got down on her knees and started to drag off my pants, she slowly stroked my
                        cock inside
                        of my underwear as to give me a small taste of what was to come. When she took of my
                        underwear she
                        was impressed by how big and stiff my cock was. She whisped her hair around to her back
                        and slowly
                        started to put her lips around the tip of my cock. The moment her lips touched my cock
                        she started
                        to use her tongue, slowly moving it from the tip to the balls. She fondled my balls a
                        bit as if to
                        measure how much sperm I had. She then started to suck on my cock, first slowly and then
                        she started
                        to go faster. I came the instant she did that.
                    </p>

                    <p>"I think we've had enough warming up, let's get to the main course."
                    </p>

                    <p>She then stood up and started to slowly drag off her dress as if to tease me. She wasn't
                        even wearing
                        anything underneath, you could tell her pussy was dripping wet as she put her hand to
                        her vagina
                        and slowly stroked it making me even more aroused. She then started to walk towards me
                        crossing her
                        legs on each step as if she was a fashion model. Well she probably was before her family
                        went bankrupt.
                        She then pushed me onto the bed and climbed on top of me and started to insert my cock
                        into her pussy.
                        It slid in so smoothly, feeling it was so much different from seeing it.
                    </p>

                    <p>Before it went entirely in I asked "Can I cum inside you?" to which she whispered into my
                        ear "Yes."
                    </p>

                    <p>I then thrust it into her full power which seemed to have startled her as I looked up to
                        see her expression.
                        I then just kept thrusting into her. At one point I even stuck it into her asshole. she
                        seemed to
                        like that more than regular. Once I was done she went to the bathroom to shower, and I
                        just dressed
                        up. Before I left the room I left her a hundred dollar tip on the drawer. As I was
                        walking towards
                        the counter I couldn't hear the moans anymore. When the man asked if I wanted to pay by
                        cash or card.
                        I said cash.
                    </p>

                    <p>The entire experience ended up being 350$. As I cheerfully walked out of the brothel I
                        could hear the
                        sound of a plane nearby. It sounded as if it was flying towards me. I looked up to see a
                        fighter
                        plane flying straight into me, then BAM!!</p>
                </div>

                            <h2>Chapter 2 - A Discussion with God</h2>
                        </center>
                        <p>I had just been struck by a fighter plane, but I didn't feel any pain. Instead it
                            felt good, it was
                            the same feeling you get when it's winter and it's really cold outside so you curl
                            up in your
                            futon. I realized that I had been seeing pure white for a few seconds now. It was
                            quite scary
                            to be exact, imagine closing your eyes and instead of seeing pure black you see just
                            your hands
                            and a pure white backdrop.
                        </p>

                        <p>I myself was a connoisseur of Light Novels so I had read these types of stories
                            before, we categorize
                            those types of stories as Isekai. My ears began to ring, and my body got heavy all
                            of a sudden.
                            It felt like I was falling in slow-motion, then as I hit the ground I landed on a
                            sofa. In front
                            of the sofa was a small little cute table with 4 cups on top of it. When I looked up
                            I saw a
                            female sitting on a big sofa naked. Her breasts were as big as my head, the nipples
                            were as pointy
                            as knives though so I wouldn't really wanna rest in them. I started to move my eyes
                            towards her
                            vagina, but instead of seeing the sweet delight that is a vagina I saw a cock
                            instead. This woman
                            was a futanari.
                        </p>

                        <p>"Where am I, Heaven?" I said whilst staring at her cock
                        </p>

                        <p>"No, this run-down place isn't as fancy as heaven, though it isn't as bad as hell
                            either. I guess
                            this place is what you could call 'The Judgement Room'. "
                        </p>

                        <p>"The Judgement Room? Why do you need a Judgement room, isn't the place we go to
                            decided by our actions?"
                        </p>

                        <p>"Well you see.. your karma isn't decided by the actions you've done in your lifetime
                            instead it's
                            decided by our judgement. We ask you some questions and you answer them, and after
                            answering
                            those questions we pass a judgement onto you."
                        </p>

                        <p>"So, people we know as good people could be down in hell?"
                        </p>

                        <p>"Yes, as a matter of fact there are probably more good people in hell than serial
                            killers."
                        </p>

                        <p>That racked my brain, then all our actions we've done on Earth never mattered?? How
                            does that make
                            sense.. If people on Earth learned about this fact there probably wouldn't be as
                            much peace as
                            there is right now.
                        </p>

                        <p>"Now we shall commence the Judgement test."
                        </p>

                        <p>"Let's see. You were born in the year 20x, that means you'd be in this category. Wait what, why aren't you anywhere in this list!?"
                        </p>

                        <p>"What do you mean?"
                        </p>

                        <p>"People of Earth descent should be automatically added to the database, but then that would mean. That'd mean your parents are from there."
                        </p>

                        <p>"What do my parents have to do with this!?"
                        </p>

                        <p>"Well you see, they're not actually from Earth. They were originally born in a
                            different universe. That place is so much different from Earth. Technology
                            there isn't
                            as advanced, and to make up for that there is magic but to keep it balanced we also
                            created monsters."
                        </p>

                        <p>"Because of the fact there isn't a trace of you on the database we're forced to send you to there."
                        </p>

                        <p>"Wait a second, does that mean I'll be reincarnated or be transferred into an already
                            existing body,
                            because i'd like the latter. As living your life a second time is such a pain in the
                            ass, i'd
                            rather have a body of someone who's 20 years old."
                        </p>

                        <p>"Well, your wish shall be granted if you don't wish for anything else. You know for
                            your troubles,
                            I'll give you a special type of magic."
                        </p>

                        <p>"What type of magic?"
                        </p>

                        <p>"You'll find out."
                        </p>

                        <p>"That does not sound good at all."
                        </p>

                        <p>She then stood up and slowly started to walk towards me, with her cock as stiff as a
                            log. She then
                            started to caress my chest, she then slowly leaned towards my ear and whispered.
                        </p>

                        <p>

                        <p>She then pushed me with her hand that was resting on my chest. I felt that sensation
                            again, that
                            I was falling in slow motion. This time instead of landing in a chair I appeared in
                            the air.
                            I looked down only to see the ground a few hundred kilometers away from me.
                        </p>

                        <p>I screamt the loudest I've ever screamt that day.

                            </center>
                            <p>As I was falling from the sky at high speeds, I began to see that there was a
                                carriage right under me. My body already became accustomed to the feeling of
                                falling quite fast, i assumed it was a skill granted to me by the god. As I
                                looke down I saw the ground getting worringly closer, so I decide to try to land
                                ontop of this carriage that I see. Just as I was about to hit the carriage, I
                                saw a glince of some fat pig with his head sticking out the window.</p>

                            <p>I crashed into the carriage with a thundering bang. I felt liquid on my face, I
                                took a drag across my face with my finger and the liquid turned out to be blood,
                                not my blood though. As I looked around me I spotted 2 females and the fat pig I
                                saw before. The women had quite voluptuous breasts, they didn't hold a candle to
                                the goddess though. The piggy was headless, oh and it was not a clean cut at
                                all. The neck stump had big splinters of wood inside them, so I assume the
                                velocity of my impact was enough to crush his head. The guards that had been
                                escorting the carriage now pointed their spears at me.</p>

                            <p><b>"PUT YOUR HANDS UP YOU FILTHY PEASANT!! YOU DARE TOUCH OUR LO-"</b></p>

                            <p>"Let me cut you off there honeybuns, I don't care about what happened here. If
                                you are unable to protect the oh so important piggy, how good of a guard are you
                                even? I bet a cockroach could have done even more."</p>

                            <p>"H-H-HOW DARE A LOWLY PEASANT TALK BACK TO ME, SOLDIERS KNOCK THIS MAN OUT"</p>

                            A guard opened the door and then came walking in honeybuns with a stern look on his
                            face.</p>
                            <p>I felt a heavy thump on the back of my head and blacked out. I woke up to the
                                smell of an old man's feet, and do not ask how I know how it smells. I was
                                surprised by how this smell of feet was making me actually quite nostalgic, I
                                had tried exploring every fetish back when I was 10 years old. I thought that no
                                fetish had gotten a reaction out of me back then, but looking back. It seemed
                                like I enjoyed every fetish in existence.

                            <p>"You are not someone registered in this state, so who do you work for?"
                            </p>

                            <p>"I obviously work for myself, oh and the goddess."

                                2 millenia, so you are obviously lying because why would they make contact now."

                                    <h2>Chapter 4 - The Trial</h2>
                                </center>
                                <p>I sit there in total silence as I wonder why the gods haven't made contact with this
                                    world in several millenia, but right now I have more important things to focus on,
                                    like my trial. Mr. Honeybuns grabs me by tbe arm and starts bringing me along to a
                                    round courtroom. In the middle of the room is a single stand with a spotlight ontop
                                    of it. He pushes me forward indicating that I should go there. I slowly walk there
                                    as I look around the room, but I can't see anything as it's too dark, all I can hear
                                    are whispers. I go stand at the stand and suddenly 3 spotlights show up ahead of me.
                                    In walk 3 men and stand on podiums. One of the men swing his arm back and then a
                                    loud, yet clear thud can be heard throughout the room. With that bang all the
                                    whipsering stops.</p>
                                <p>"State your name." says the man that had swung the hammer.</p>
                                <p>"Rak Dilf, 20 years old."</p>
                                <p>"Do you know the severity of your crime Rak Dilf?"</p>
                                <p>"No sir. I do not, it was just some fat piggy who happened to be in the way."</p>
                                <p>"How dare you call the lord of this state a mere 'fat piggy'. His highness ended up
                                    getting murdered by you. Now state who you work for, Rak Dilf."</p>
                                <p>"I work for no-one except myself, earlier I also mentioned to Mr. Honeybuns that I
                                    work for the gods as a joke. But how could those 'lowly' gods who haven't contaced
                                    us in millenia control me." Just as I muttered those words, I felt a throbbing
                                    headache overcome me. As the headache calmed down I heard the goddesses voice within
                                    my head, almost as if it was my inner-voice.</p>
                                <p>"How dare you talk smack about me, I do not care if the residents of this world talk
                                    bad about me, but you someone who was transported from another world may not talk
                                    bad about me. Do that another time I will strike judgment down on you." That message
                                    had left me on my guard with a surprised expression on my face.</p>
                                <p>The judge then slams down his hammer "Rak Dilf, RESPOND TO ME! Are you ready to
                                    accept the consequences for your crime?"</p>
                                <p>"W-what, I didn't hear what you said. But I'm just gonna assume it was something
                                    boring and I'm gonna say yes."</p>
                                <p>"Now that you are ready to face the consequences for killing the lord of the state
                                    you will be executed in 4 lunar days. Until then you'll be kept within your cell and
                                    fed the minimum requirement to keep you alive. Guards take him to his cell."</p>
                                <p>As he said that Mr. Honeybuns came and took me by the hand with some other guard.</p>
                                <p>"So Mr. Honeybuns, how is the job treating you? Able to find any woman willing to
                                    look at your face for a split-second?"</p>
                                <p>"Why do you keep calling me Mr. Honeybuns?! Call me by my real name Edward sin Carne"
                                </p>
                                <p>"Mr. Honeybuns sin Carne, I call you honeybuns because you got some fat cheeks down
                                    there. Juicier than any honey I've seen on the streets. Oh and well you also look so
                                    weak and soft."</p>
                                <p>I got no response, just a face full of anger. The other guard that had been carrying
                                    me by the hand had kept his silence the entire time and just walked along. But I
                                    felt like this walk to the cell has taken too long. As it took them just a minute to
                                    bring me from the cell to the courtroom before but we've been walking for 5 minutes
                                    already. Then suddenly the guard who had been keeping his silence takes out a spade
                                    and slams Mr. Honeybuns sin Carne on the back of his head taking him down on the
                                    ground quickly. He then releases the grip on me.></p>
                                <p>"Come on, follow me."</p>

                                    <p>"Wait.. that would mean she's done this multiple times in the past, and very
                                        recently."</p>
                                    <p>"Actually, her last transport was not recent at all. One of the blessings you get
                                        from the goddess is protection against death by natural causes. So if you stay
                                        in hiding and never be caught you would technically be immortal. And because of
                                        that blessing she sends people here every 25 years. I was the 482nd generation
                                        whilst you're the 517th generation."</p>
                                    <p>"Wait.. if you're the 482nd generation that means you're almost 900 years old."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>"Give or take. Because we can't die of natural causes we don't age that's why I
                                        still look like I'm in my 20s."</p>
                                    <p>"Now I'm really grateful I asked her for a body that was in the 20s. But how did
                                        you guys even know where to find me?"</p>
                                    <p>"The goddess does this routine everytime someone crosses over so it becomes
                                        easier to pinpoint your location, because there's not alot of trials for killing
                                        a noble."</p>
                                    <p>"Guess she uses our crossover as a way to kill someone she doesn't like."</p>
                                    <p>"Indeed. But don't worry about that right now we're almost at our destination."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>"Where are you even taking me?"</p>
                                    <p>"To the HQ. We made it so we could easily communicate between each other and keep
                                        track of newcomers."</p>
                                    <p>"May I ask.. Since I'm the 517th generation how many people are still alive?"</p>
                                    <p>"Not that many people have died as they've all been careful. Around 400 of us are
                                        still alive. Most importantly our leader, the 1st generation is still alive."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>"But why do you guys call each crossover a new generation? It's not like multiple
                                        people come out at once."</p>
                                    <p>"It's just our leader wasn't very literate so he couldn't come up with any words
                                        other than generation, and it kinda stuck around."</p>
                                    <p>We were almost near the exit as I could see the light getting closer. When we
                                        stepped out the tunnel he told me we have to also climb up the mountain to reach
                                        the HQ, so we started climbing whilst the sun was still rising. By the time we
                                        reached the summit the sun was setting. But there was nothing there. Not a
                                        single sign of life even. He suddenly picked up a rock and threw it at the sun.
                                        When he did that a portal opened up behind him, after a few seconds of
                                        reassuring myself I went through it.</p>
                                    <p>"Welcome to our HQ."</p>
                                    <p>There it was, the glorious headquarters. It looked like a modern New York
                                        skyscraper so it looked very out of place with this world's architecture. It's
                                        time to finally meet the other's I guess.</p>
