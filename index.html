					<h2>7 Days of Horror</h2>
				</center>
				<center>
					<p>This page will contain short stories that I wrote in the period of a week. I started doing this
						on the 28th of December.</p>
				</center>
				<center>
					<h2>Day #1</h2>
				</center>
				<p>It was a cold december night and I was freezing so I deicded to throw some logs into the fireplace to
					keep the place warm as I didn't have access to normal heating in the middle of the woods. I was
					alone that night as my parents were on a trip and my girlfriend was celebrating christmas with her
					parents so I had this cabin all to myself. Suddenly a heavy snowstorm started so I decided to lay
					under a blanket infront of the fireplace and listen to the album my girlfriend gifted to me as a
					christmas present. I relaxed there for a few hours just enjoying music and a warm cup of tea. I
					started to feel hungry so I decided to go to the kitchen. I looked through my drawers for any
					snacks, but see no heavenly snack in sight. I had heard somewhere that drinking water helps satiate
					hunger, and with that information in mind I decided to get a cold glass of water. Whilst I was
					waiting for the water from the tap to fill the cup I lookedoutside the window to spot some
					footprints deep inside the heavy snow, almost as if they were just made.</p>
				<center>
					<h2>Day 2</h2>
				</center>
				<p>I woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. I could not remember my dream but I could feel
					a few drops of tears on my cheeks. I rush out of bed and run into the bathroom and drink water, and
					whilst I'm drinking the water one i can feel my left eye start to twitch alot but I think nothing of
					it. As I start walking to my room I felt this uncomfortable feeling as if like something was wrong,
					like my apartment wasn't the same. Some rooms felt bigger and some felt smaller. I went to my room
					and pulled up the curtain to see no cityscape outside the window, but just a big eye staring at me.
					I fall backwards onto the ground and start scrambling away and as I sprint to my door I can see the
					door handle start to slowly turn. I frantically look around me to see if I can hide anywhere. I look
					and look but the only place that was big enough to fit my body was the bottom of my bed. I just got
					under the bed when the door finally opened. Tentacles slid across the ground and they seemed to be
					going to the otherside of the room. Suddenly it turns around and dashes to my bed but then the
					tentacles disappear as if they went ontop of the bed. I'm so nervous that I keep shaking and I
					suddenly feel especially wet and cold around my crotch. I thought I had peed myself but no, there
					was a hole through the bed with a tentacle through it going straight into my body and the wet liquid
					was my blood. I scream out in agony as more tentacles procceed to stab me. As my vision is fading I
					see the giant eye outside the window looking at me almost as if it was smiling, and then suddenly
					pitch black.
					I woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat...</p>
				<center>
					<h2>Day 3</h2>
				</center>
				<p>I had just gotten home from my job, I had tried to walk home as slowly as possible to not feel the dread of my empty, dark apartment but I was here now. I go put my bag on the kitchen counter and open the fridge. I had some leftovers from yesterday, but I didn't feel like eating those so I decided to just make a quick sandwich. I turn on the TV in the meanwhile and the news are just talking about another murder this time eerily close to my home but I think nothing of it. I walk to my couch and just lay-back. I take my time eating the sandwich whilst watching the news. After around 30 minutes I finally finish the sandwich but I still feel hungry, just not at my stomach. I go to my kitchen and pull a knife out from a drawer and put it in my back pocket. I go outside my apartment and lock the doors. It is around 10pm so there shouldn't be that many people out on the streets. I go outside my apartment complex and see my neighbor that lives across the hall. I walk up to them and talk with them about how their day has been, they decided to invite me upstairs for a cup of tea without knowing that would be their biggest mistake. I go with them into their apartment complex and sit down at their dinner table whilst they are brewing the water. I wait for them to bring the cups of tea to the table and sit down. The moment they sit down I grab my cup of tea and throw it at their face, they scream in agony from the boiling hot water. To make them be quiet I push them down on the ground and stomp my foot onto their mouth, possibly breaking a few teeth. I start to squat down with my foot still in their mouth and pull out the knife from my back pocket. I start to play around with it, dragging the dull side of the blade against their skin whilst laughing playfully. I then flip the blade so the sharp side is facing them and then start to drag it across their face. They look to be in so much pain, but that makes it even better. I then stab it into their hand and yank it out splitting their hand in two. Blood starts gushing out like a waterfall but I don't care. I just continue slashing away at their face whilst they are running out of blood. After a few minutes of slashing I decide to slowly start to insert it into their eye, they are still alive so you can see them just wriggling around trying to break free. When the blade is one third of the way in, I stab it in with full force and they die. Since my play-toy is now dead, I decide to just butcher them up. I first begin by ripping off their nails and replace the teeth with them. I then break the elbows and knees to pose them in uncomfortable positions. I decide to position them against the window where the entire street can see them. After I finish propping them up, I stab my blade into their belly button and pull down cutting straight through their genitalia. The news will be reporting on this murder tomorrow..</p>

					<h2>Favourite Game Series</h2>

				<center>
					<p>Here are my two favourite game series</p>
				</center>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<h3>The Yakuza Series</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/yakuza.jpg" alt="" /></span>The entire series is
							amazing with it's story. Two reasons why this game series is so great is because of the
							SUBSTORIES and the MINIGAMES the games have, the substories are the exact opposite of what
							the story sometimes can be and you can lose yourself in the minigames.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Persona Series</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/persona5.jpg" alt="" /></span>I didn't really like
							JRPG's until I played Persona 5. Everything about Persona 5 is amazing, the OST, the
							character designs and most importantly the vibe the game has, it's one of the best i've ever
							experienced. </p>
