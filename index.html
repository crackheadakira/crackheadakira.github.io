					<h2>7 Days of Horror</h2>
				</center>
				<center>
					<p>This page will contain short stories that I wrote in the period of a week. I started doing this on the 28th of December.</p>
				</center>
				<center>
					<h2>Day #1</h2>
				</center>
				<p>It was a cold december night and I was freezing so I deicded to throw some logs into the fireplace to
					keep the place warm as I didn't have access to normal heating in the middle of the woods. I was
					alone that night as my parents were on a trip and my girlfriend was celebrating christmas with her
					parents so I had this cabin all to myself. Suddenly a heavy snowstorm started so I decided to lay
					under a blanket infront of the fireplace and listen to the album my girlfriend gifted to me as a
					christmas present. I relaxed there for a few hours just enjoying music and a warm cup of tea. I
					started to feel hungry so I decided to go to the kitchen. I looked through my drawers for any
					snacks, but see no heavenly snack in sight. I had heard somewhere that drinking water helps satiate
					hunger, and with that information in mind I decided to get a cold glass of water. Whilst I was
					waiting for the water from the tap to fill the cup I lookedoutside the window to spot some
					footprints deep inside the heavy snow, almost as if they were just made.</p>
				<center>
					<h2>Day #1.5</h2>
				</center>
				<p>I woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. I could not remember my dream but I could feel
					a few drops of tears on my cheeks. I rush out of bed and run into the bathroom and drink water, and
					whilst I'm drinking the water one i can feel my left eye start to twitch alot but I think nothing of
					it. As I start walking to my room I felt this uncomfortable feeling as if like something was wrong,
					like my apartment wasn't the same. Some rooms felt bigger and some felt smaller. I went to my room
					and pulled up the curtain to see no cityscape outside the window, but just a big eye staring at me.
					I fall backwards onto the ground and start scrambling away and as I sprint to my door I can see the
					door handle start to slowly turn. I frantically look around me to see if I can hide anywhere. I look
					and look but the only place that was big enough to fit my body was the bottom of my bed. I just got
					under the bed when the door finally opened. Tentacles slid across the ground and they seemed to be
					going to the otherside of the room. Suddenly it turns around and dashes to my bed but then the
					tentacles disappear as if they went ontop of the bed. I'm so nervous that I keep shaking and I
					suddenly feel especially wet and cold around my crotch. I thought I had peed myself but no, there
					was a hole through the bed with a tentacle through it going straight into my body and the wet liquid
					was my blood. I scream out in agony as more tentacles procceed to stab me. As my vision is fading I
					see the giant eye outside the window looking at me almost as if it was smiling, and then suddenly
					pitch black.
					I woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat...</p>

				<center>
					<p>Here are my two favourite game series</p>
				</center>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<h3>The Yakuza Series</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/yakuza.jpg" alt="" /></span>The entire series is
							amazing with it's story. Two reasons why this game series is so great is because of the
							SUBSTORIES and the MINIGAMES the games have, the substories are the exact opposite of what
							the story sometimes can be and you can lose yourself in the minigames.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Persona Series</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/persona5.jpg" alt="" /></span>I didn't really like
							JRPG's until I played Persona 5. Everything about Persona 5 is amazing, the OST, the
							character designs and most importantly the vibe the game has, it's one of the best i've ever
							experienced. </p>
